  #For my first ever data analysis project, I have looked at a dataset from Kaggle that includes the sleep quality, stress levels, occupations, activity levels, genders, and many more interesting data of over 300 people. In the project, I first looked at the stress levels with regards to the occupation and gender; and then I examined the sleep durations and sleep qualities accordingly. 

 #As I did not know what exactly I wanted from the data, I first explored it randomly and then found relationships that interested me. Then, using these relations, I have pulled the data from sql and inserted it to tableau to create a dashboard.
